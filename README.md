# Optical-Character-Recognition

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a method for extracting text from images and turning it into machine-readable text that programmers can access and alter as a string variable (or any other computer language). However, using OCR, the image can be converted into a text file and its constituent parts recorded as text data.

##Dataset used
MNIST is the “Hello World” dataset for computer vision (“Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology”). Since its 1999 publication, this well-known collection of handwritten images has served as the standard for categorization algorithms. Even as new machine learning techniques are created, MNIST remains a reliable resource.
